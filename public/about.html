            <h1 class="about">Hi.</h1>
            <p class="about">Welcome to my portfolio! I am Amanda. To some of you reading this, I am just 
                another potential employee so, I made this website to show you how much I really 
                enjoy doing what I do! I went through a hard time during my undergrad understanding <i>what</i> it 
                is that I truly want to do with my life. It was a rough four years for me to continue with Computer
                science and also have an attachment for art and digital design. I figured I can go for both fields! 
                I was pretty lucky because I freed up my schedule after taking elective classes at Clark College to fill the prerequisites. 
                It was then, after taking multiple DTC classes at Washington State University of Vancouver that I realized, I love creating websites and designing UI/UX. 
                <br><br>
                Don't get me wrong, I love art and designing but I still want coding to be part of my life. I want to fill my future employer in any aspect they would like me to fill.
                Whether that's creating artwork, building web apps, or being apart of creating something that works. Coding has taught me valuable experience which includes: clear 
                communication within a team, extreme debugging, good commit messages, and also some creativity. During my 4-years in undergrad, I find these
                traits have pushed me to be the best I can be as a computer scientist.
